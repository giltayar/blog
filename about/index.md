35 years of experience have not dulled the fascination I have with software development.
From the olden days of DOS, to the contemporary world of Software Testing,
I was, is, and always will be, a software developer.
I have in the past co-founded WebCollage, survived the bubble collapse of 2000,
and worked on various big cloudy projects at Wix, Cloudshare, and Applitools.

My current passion is figuring out how to test software,
a passion which I have turned into his main job as Evangelist and Senior Architect at Applitools.
I have religiously tested all his software,
from the early days as a junior software developer to the current days at Applitools,
where I develop tests for software that tests software,
which is almost one meta layer too many for me.

In my private life, I am a dad to two lovely kids (and a cat),
an avid reader of Science Fiction, (he counts Samuel Delany, Robert Silverberg,
and Robert Heinlein as favorites) and a passionate film buff.
(Stanley Kubrick, Lars Von Trier, David Cronenberg, anybody?)

Unfortunately for me,
I haven't really answered the big question of his life--I still don't
know whether static languages or dynamic languages are best.

## This is me
